[ARTICLE 1: Developers Compete To Bring Smart Contracts To Dogecoin Ecosystem - "The Defiant"]

An increasing number of projects are working to bring smart contract functionality to the Dogecoin ecosystem.  On Sunday, Laika, a Layer 2 solution for Dogecoin, on mainnet. The project claims to comprise the first Layer 2 network in the Dogecoin ecosystem.  “Starting on July 28th, you will be able to interact with the first Layer 2 on Dogecoin and become one of the earliest users of DogFi,” theLaika Foundation on Medium.  Alongside introducing smart contracts to the Dogecoin ecosystem, Laika also aims to improve transaction speeds. The project claims block confirmation speeds of 3 seconds, compared to one minute on Dogecoin. However, Laika’s testnet performance average block times of 4.3 seconds.  On Sunday, Laika's testnet hosted 2,820 daily transactions, down from its all-time high of 24,600 transactions on July 16. Overall, the testnet processed a total of 608,039 transactions and hosted 42,558 wallets. On the same day, the Dogecoin network processed transactions, according to Messari.  ## The race to bring smart contracts to Dogecoin  While Dogecoin started as a light-hearted fork-of-a-fork of Litecoin in 2013, developers are working to mature the network beyond merely hosting memecoin transfers and mining operations.  On July 26, Qed Protocol a new Dogecoin opcode that would pave the way for DeFi applications and NFTs to launch natively on Dogecoin. The project said its proposal has support from top mining pools including AntPool, ViaBTC, and F2Pool.  “With the introduction of this opcode… the Dogecoin Network will effectively be the first PoW secured chain at feature parity with blockchains like Ethereum and with the scalability of Solana,” Feldman said.  QED is also working to launch a on Dogecoin.  In 2022, the Dogechain sidechain sought to pioneer smart contract functionality within the ecosystem. Dogechain uses the Polygon Edge tech stack to offer compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), Ethereum’s core smart contract engine — allowing developers to port dApps built for EVM onto the network.  Dogechain hosted nearly 46,000 transactions on July 28, down from around 103,500 transactions on July 3, according to the Dogechain . However, the network’s total value locked (TVL) is just $3.49 million, according to DeFi Llama.  Developers also sought to bring onto Dogecoin last year in response to their surging success on Bitcoin. In February 2023, Doginals inscriptions went live, followed by Cardinals in May 2023. The Cardinals team followed up that same month by launching the DRC-20 fungible token standard on Dogecoin — drawing inspiration from Bitcoin’s BRC-20 standard.  ## Bridging Dogecoin to smart contract networks  While some projects are seeking to introduce EVM capabilities to the Dogecoin ecosystem, others are looking to tap into Dogecoin’s vibrant community and strong adoption by enabling holders to bridge their DOGE onto networks that natively support smart contracts.  In June, the Dfinity Foundation began ckDOGE, offering on-chain alternative to wrapped tokens that allows users to bridge DOGE from Dogecoin onto the Internet Computer network. The token leverages , which enables cross-chain interoperability without using a centralized architecture, unlike conventional token wrappers.  Flare Network is also on a protocol enabling cross-chain DOGE bridging in the form of F-Assets, allowing the token’s use in smart contracts on the Flare network. Flare F-Assets in open beta on June 4 following its November 2023 testnet deployment.  is up 0.74% in the past 24 hours, according to The Defiant's crypto price feeds.  As the rivalry between the Solana and Ethereum ecosystem wages on, Ethereum is far closer to achieving economic sustainability.  On Nov. 1, Michael Nadeau, the founder of The DeFi Report, flagged a steep imbalance between the economic sustainability of Ethereum and Solana.  Citing from Token Terminal, Nadeau found that for every $1 of fee revenue generated by Ethereum, the network paid an average of $1.28 in the form of newly minted ETH to stakers during 2024. In total, the network emitted $2.65 billion worth of ETH to generate $2.06 billion in revenue.  By contrast, Solana has paid out $3.26 billion and earned $428 million in fees year-to-date, equating to an expense of roughly $7.62 per $1 in revenue. With 87% of Solana fees generated in 2024, Solana’s inflation-to-revenue ratio was even steeper in prior years.  “An L1 becomes profitable from an on-chain perspective when its fee revenues are able to compensate the supply side of the network,” Nadeau .  Meanwhile, Ethereum earned more in fee revenue than it emitted as inflation throughout most of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024, with revenue slumping following the fee reductions realized by Ethereum’s in March.  However, Nadeau acknowledged that a high inflation-to-revenue ratio is “necessary” for a network to bootstrap adoption. “Ethereum also had high inflation during its formative years,” Nadeau said.  The dynamics also mean that SOL stakers are enjoying higher returns than Ethereum validators.  ## Solana’s 2024 rise  The analysis comes as Solana is enjoying a banner year, with the network emerging as a hub for memecoin speculation. Solana’s memecoin ecosystem has exploded following the launch of , a no-code token launchpad facilitating the creation of tens of thousands of memecoins each day, in January, according to .  According to , Solana-based DEXes hosted $1.7 billion in average daily volume throughout Q3, up 325% from $400 million in Q4 2023. The total value locked in Solana’s DeFi ecosystem is also up 280% over the same period, buoyed by the market cap of stablecoins on the network doubling and a 663% rise in the price of SOL.  The data highlights a shift towards DEX trading and DeFi use cases on Solana in 2024 while NFT activity has declined. Solana’s daily NFT volume has crashed 67% to $2.5 million in Q3 from $7.6 million in Q1 2024.  In the wake of Operation Chokepoint 2.0, crypto developer share in North America continues to fall. Asia is now the number one location for blockchain talent.  The recent report from Electric Capital shows North America’s steady decline in terms of crypto developer market share, to about 23% in 2024, compared with nearly 25% last year and roughly 27% in 2022. North America had 45% of developer share in 2015, when the data set started.  Meanwhile, Asia’s lead widened in 2024 after edging out Europe for the leading spot last year, now commanding just under a 35% share.  Developer Market Share - Electric Capital  While the market belonged to North America back in 2015, Europe has been in control of the global crypto developer market share since 2017. Asia’s developer share has slowly increased over the last nine years and is now the dominant force in the market.  **U.S. Government Forces Out Developers**  The United States remains the country for crypto developers, but the nation's market share is on a steady decline as regulators continue to crack down on the industry.  Analysts such as Nic Carter have been pointing the finger at the Biden administration’s “sinister” efforts to squash the industry, in a movement dubbed .  Operation Chokepoint 2.0 refers to an effort to choke out the crypto industry within the United States. The shutdowns of Silicon Valley Bank and Silvergate Bank in 2023 remain Carter’s primary examples of Chokepoint 2.0.  In addition to this movement, the Securities and Exchanges Commission (SEC) is still coming after crypto companies in the United States despite its string of legal losses in such cases. The SEC continues its regulation by enforcement efforts, handing out Wells Notices to companies including Uniswap, Immutable and Crypto.com, which forces companies to take legal action against the agency in order to defend themselves.  Most recently gaming company Immutable received a Wells Notice on . The company was quick to call out the SEC’s “spray and pray” approach.  As a result, the United States has had a in developer share since 2015.  Sid Ramesh of Coinbase took to X to speak on Electric Capital’s findings and “The future of crypto is getting built outside the US. Almost certain the adoption will outpace in other markets without a friendly regulatory regime.”

[ARTICLE 2: QED, Nexus aim to bring smart contracts to Dogecoin]

Blockchain developers QED Protocol and Nexus are preparing to launch a layer-2 (L2) scaling solution designed to bring smart contracts to the Dogecoin network, according to a Sept. 26 announcement.  The planned L2, a zero-knowledge virtual machine (zkVM), aims to “enable the world’s oldest and most popular memecoin network to compete in the smart-contract realm with the likes of Ethereum and Solana,” QED and Nexus in a statement.  Dogecoin operates on a proof-of-work (PoW) blockchain network similar to Bitcoin’s but with less computationally intensive transaction verifications and no upper limit on total Dogecoin supply. Dogecoin does not support smart contracts.  Launching a high-throughput zkEVM on Dogecoin will help “to make the world’s foremost memecoin network ‘STRONKer than all the others,’” QED and Nexus said.  _Source: Dogecoin_  _**Related:**_  In 2024, the memecoin market in the crypto space.  Smart contract platforms for memecoins are often highly profitable, with Solana’s Pump.fun surpassing $100 million in revenues in August.  The Dogecoin zkVM aims to “include tools that empower developers to create a wide variety of high-performance applications on the network that could include everything from decentralized exchanges to NFTs,” according to the announcement.  Initially launched in 2013 as a satirical commentary on Bitcoin , DOGE now commands a total market capitalization of approximately $17 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap. DOGE is widely considered the first “memecoin” but is also used for micropayments and tipping.  QED protocol has already developed a zkVM scaling solution on the Bitcoin network designed to support smart contracts and low-latency transactions. Nexus operates Nexus zkVM, a modular scaling network using zero-knowledge proofs.  Scaling solutions settling on PoW blockchains such as Bitcoin are proliferating. According to data from DefiLlama, the total value locked (TVL) on Bitcoin’s L2s surged to approximately $1.4 billion in September.  “What we are doing with Dogecoin can certainly be replicated in other ecosystems… thanks to recent breakthroughs in zero-knowledge technology,” said Daniel Marin, Nexus’ CEO.  _**Magazine:**_  Explore more articles like this  Subscribe to the Nifty Newsletter  Your go-to source for staying on top of market trends, and emerging artists, and unlocking opportunities in the NFT landscape.

[ARTICLE 3: Data: The number of Dogecoin holding addresses has exceeded 5 million, with fewer than 5,000 addresses controlling over 80% of the DOGE supply - ChainCatcher]

ChainCatcher news, according to CoinDesk, the number of cryptocurrency addresses holding Dogecoin has surpassed 5 million for the first time. Meanwhile, the number of active addresses on the network has more than doubled, reaching 168,000, the highest level since March 2022.  However, according to BitInfoCharts , fewer than 5,000 addresses control over 80% of the DOGE supply, meaning that relatively few traders can influence the price of the cryptocurrency.

[ARTICLE 4: Dogecoin (DOGE): The Significance of a Joke Crypto | Gemini]

## Cultural Significance of Dogecoin  is heavily influenced by the ebb and flow of social media. Specifically, DOGE has received Twitter shoutouts from celebrities. For example, Elon Musk jokingly accepted an appointment as CEO of Dogecoin as the result of a public poll on Twitter. Then in July 2020, a social media campaign on TikTok called on millions of users to purchase $25 USD worth of DOGE tokens to push the price of DOGE to $1. Some consider this campaign to have been an illegal “” scheme to drive up the price for the benefit of current DOGE holders so that they could sell at a profit. While the push fell short of its stated benchmark, it did manage to increase the price of DOGE by more than 600%. While a seemingly trivial pursuit, this event highlights the power that social media can hold in attracting wider crypto adoption.  The significance of Dogecoin has continued to spill over into other aspects of popular culture as well. An example of this is Dogeminer — a web-based video game (also available on the Google Play store) that simulates the  of Dogecoin. It teaches players the basic logistics of cryptocurrency mining in a fun and approachable way, leading many players to deeper involvement in the crypto community at large.  ## How to Use DOGE  Dogecoin was not intended to be an investment or . Instead, Dogecoin’s primary practical function so far has been as a form of tipping (especially in online settings). People donate DOGE to online content creators for funny, informative, or otherwise noteworthy content. Tipping content creators on Reddit, Twitter, and Twitch is yet another example of cryptocurrency’s entanglement with social media and popular internet culture.  ## The Good-Willed Dogecoin Community  The charitable spirit of DOGE tipping has expanded into full-fledged charitable causes. DOGE has been used to support numerous donation campaigns, ranging from silly to noble.  In support of the silly, the Dogecoin community essentially crowd-funded a sponsorship for an underdog Nascar driver as a sort of publicity stunt. Reddit users identified Nascar racer Josh Wise as an up-and-coming racer who was sponsorless. Within eight days of fundraising, Wise was fully sponsored to compete in a Nascar race at the famous Talladega Superspeedway thanks to his new sponsor, the Dogecoin community. Wise received Dogecoin crypto donations totaling $55,000, and he raced in a Dogecoin-wrapped Chevrolet with a sizable Shiba Inu — Dogecoin’s emblematic mascot — on the hood.  As for the charitable causes, through Colorado-based nonprofit the Dogecoin Foundation, the Dogecoin community has fulfilled the following donation campaigns:  - $25,000 to 4 Paws For Ability, a nonprofit that trains service animals for children and veterans with disabilities  - More than $30,000 to send athletes from India and Africa to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia  - In excess of $30,000 to a nonprofit campaign that aims to provide access to clean drinking water in Kenya via a program called Doge4Water   On an unofficial level, the Dogecoin community has a track record of supporting content creators with , as well as supporting charitable organizations with much larger donations. Yet on an organizational level, the Dogecoin Foundation has been inactive since 2015, which was also the same year that Dogecoin last received significant technical updates.

[ARTICLE 5: Why Celebrities Love Dogecoin: From Elon Musk to Lil Yachty - Decrypt]

Dogecoin is fast acquiring celebrity fans from rappers and YouTubers to bodybuilders and even a cat lady. Dogecoin's erstwhile CEO, Elon Musk, started the trend. Most recently, TikTok influencers have been trying to pump the coin's price to reach $1.  Dogecoin is the crypto joke that just keeps on giving. The latest twist in its comical history is its adoption by a virtual tour bus of celebrities, who are intent on taking it to the moon.  It’s ironic because —or “,” as Internet celebrity Mia Khalifacalls it—was invented as a riposte to ; it was meant as a send-up of the full-on madness of the cryptocurrency industry, where hype is a common denominator, and memes rule.  The coin, featuring “Doge,” a cute, Japanese Shibu Inu dog, even has its own meme-language. “Much wow!” and “such vroom,” says Doge, often while riding a rocket to the moon. It was created in 2013 by two developers: Australian Jackson Palmer and American Billy Markus. “It was always like a hobby project, like a side project thing,” .  But, at some $5 billion, the cryptocurrency’s market cap is no joke, and, , Palmer has been . “I made a lot of people rich but I didn’t come away with any money,” he said.  Markus and Palmer left the project in 2015, but Dogecoin’s super-active community, low price, and low transaction costs have meant that it’s stayed, somewhat doggedly, in the top 40 most valuable coins. And when the richest man in the world took an interest, things took on an even more bizarre turn.  Elon Musk has been tweeting about Dogecoin since at least April 2, 2019, when he shared a satirical article from _The Onion_ about Bitcoin price volatility and added: “Dogecoin value may vary.” He followed up with: “Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.”  Since then, Musk has treated his followers to a series of increasingly creative Dogecoin tweets, including “,” and “throw a dogecoin to ur witcher," a reference to a song in the popular Netflix show The Witcher (he later deleted the tweet.) Then, when a community poll mooted his appointment to honorary CEO, he accepted with alacrity and even changed his Twitter bio to “Dogecoin CEO” to reflect his new appointment.  His posts have significantly ; after one  in December 2020, Dogecoin  by 17%, and someone has even offered to pay $7,777 for a tokenized replica of one of his Dogecoin tweets.  But this was nothing compared to what happened last week, when Dogecoin became the latest obsession of retail traders, at least partly due to Musk posting an image of a tasteful “Dogue” magazine cover. He provided no comment, but the reference was clear.  Whether Musk’s tweet was what whetted the appetite of the WallStreetBets crowd for DOGE, nobody knows for sure. The Reddit sub’s official mods don’t endorse crypto but, fresh from its now-infamous, some —and many inspired by it—were looking for a new target.  They piled into Dogecoin, and a host of new celebrity supporters joined the ride. , a Lebanese-American Internet celebrity, was one of the new celebrity converts. She rose to fame on Pornhub, later joining the OnlyFans social media platform, and now has 15 million followers on TikTok.  The surge of interest saw DOGE shoot from around $0.01 to over $0.07 overnight, but the coin failed to reach the set target of $1 (even though it was riled on by  and other platforms), and has since crashed to $0.03, with Khalifa one of those who got (not a little) REKT.  Dogecoin has attracted rap stars, YouTubers, bodybuilders and actors. The volume of tweets from high-profile fans has increased steadily since last summer, alongside Musk’s enthusiasm for Dogecoin.  American rapper Lil Yachty has reportedly said that he is planning to invest  in Dogecoin, and has shilled the crypto since earlier this month.  But Dogecoin isn’t exclusive to the rap fraternity. Kiss guitarist Gene Simmons revealed on Monday that he’d , alongside other cryptocurrencies, and Australian DJ Alison Wonderland garnered 5,000 likes when she .  And other new, Dogecoin aficionados include YouTubers, such as , creator of entertainment show #DramaAlert, who has 2.4 million Twitter followers and has supported the crypto since July 2020. Another fan is Welsh YouTuber , who is known for his pranks, usually on his brother Elliot, and has 4.6 million subscribers.  Instagram star Joey Knoll (two million Twitter followers) has also  (several times in fact.) He also  on his feed that fellow bodybuilder and Mr. Olympia favorite  has also bought in.  Then there are the thespians: South African actor  is a fan. The 19-year-old is best known for his affiliation with popular web crew “, ” and has featured in shows including “The Unsettling,” “Code Black” and “Light As A Feather.”  Cameo, a service that lets people pay celebrities to read out custom messages, has been responsible for at least part of the celebrity pump.  Rapper, entrepreneur, and streamer Soulja Boy (a.k.a. Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em)  via a  earlier this month. He has 5.2 million followers on Twitter alone.  “Yo Dogecoin Army, it’s going down man. Make sure y’all tap in for Dogecoin, man, it’s gonna be the crypto of the future. Dogecoin is the people’s coin. Let’s go. It’s your boy, Soulja Boy,” he said in the video, which, it transpired, he was paid to post by one of his subscribers via Cameo.  Big-cats activist Carole Baskin from Netflix's "Tiger King," was one of the more unlikely celebs to endorse Dogecoin. In her TikTok video, which appears to have been paid for by videogame character artist Jay Doherty, she mulls that her benefactor may have reached out to the wrong person:  “I’m supposed to be the Mother Theresa of cats,” said Baskin. Nevertheless, she’s sure that “doggies are going to the moon," and asks everyone to “donate to #dodge-coin \[SIC\] to help all the animals if you can.” Say, what?  Dogecoin has seen . In July 2020, a viral TikTok challenge sent Dogecoin volumes soaring, pushing the price up by 96%. But the flurry of price action soon passed.  The truth is that, despite the very best of intentions, “a dollar-a-DOGE” is something of a fantasy, , who point out that the cryptocurrency’s market cap makes such price predictions impossible.  And Musk? In a on Monday, he was finally forced to reveal his true motivations and said that his tweets about Dogecoin were not meant to be taken seriously.  "Occasionally I make jokes about dogecoin, but they are really just meant to be jokes," he said.  His pronouncements could be seen as testing the cryptocurrency waters; Dogecoin has always been an easy gateway drug to the hard stuff: Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the legions of decentralized finance (DeFi) coins that make up the crypto universe.  But Musk also noted that "fate loves irony,” pointing out that “the most entertaining outcome and the most ironic outcome would be that Dogecoin becomes the “currency of earth in the future"—a state of events that would certainly generate a bucket load of Wow.
